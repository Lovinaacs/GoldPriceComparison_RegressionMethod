# Gold Price Comparison Using RegressionMethod
This repository provides the R code for a comprehensive analysis of gold price prediction. The project utilizes various regression models to forecast gold prices based on historical data spanning from 2000 to 2022. Key factors considered in the analysis include date, volume, open price, and close price.

After comparing the performance of Linear, Logistic, Lasso, and Ridge Regression models, the Lasso Regression model emerged as the most effective in predicting gold prices. Future research directions include extending the analysis to examine gold price fluctuations during global monetary crises, investigating the relationship between gold price and gold mining fluctuations, and exploring the correlation between gold price, stock market returns, and inflation.

## Additional Information
This code was developed as part of my final project for the Data Mining and Visualization course. The code is specifically designed to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of gold price prediction through the application of various regression methods. This project not only showcases the analytical capabilities learned throughout the course but also aims to provide valuable insights into gold price dynamics using historical data.
